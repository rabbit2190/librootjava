           libsuperuser does not normally allow calls on the main thread, to prevent its users
           from blocking Android's UI. This is not relevant here as there is no UI thread.

           The detection calls never trigger as the main thread does not have an associated Looper.
           However, if the RootJava::getSystemContext() call is used, a Looper is created, and the
           checks trigger again.

           For Shell.SH calls, calling Debug.setSanityChecksEnabled(false) (done in the main()
           method) is enough to bypass these checks, but it still causes issues for the
           Shell.Interactive class. The solution is to make sure the callbacks run in a separate
           thread of our own choosing.

           You would normally create just one of these in your initialization code and clean it
           up just before exiting, but we do it all in one go here to keep the sample
           self-contained.

                   You may be tempted to pass a ParcelFileDescriptor instead,
                   but note that those are still limited by SELinux contexts and file permissions.
                   If you were to pass a ParcelFileDescriptor referencing for example /init.rc,
                   which the non-root part of the app doesn't have access to, opening the
                   file would work fine on this end, but passing the descriptor would fail.

                   Another possibility is to create a pipe (see ParcelFileDescriptor again),
                   and send the contents of the file through that, then create an InputStream
                   on that pipe on the other end.

                   You wouldn't normally do something like this anyway, rather you would have
                   the non-root part of the app send a command to do something with a file on
                   this end, process it here, and return whether the operation was successful.

                   This serves as an example of how to pass a secondary interface and how to
                   wrap an object, rather than doing something practically useful.

                   We catch IOExceptions and return null instead. You should never throw an
                   exception in your Binder interface implementation, by far most of them do not
                   propagate, but some of them do, making handling weird. We do log the exception
                   to logcat so we can pick it up during development.
