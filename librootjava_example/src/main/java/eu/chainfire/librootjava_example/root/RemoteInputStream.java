/**
 * Example helper class to pass InputStreams through Binder
 * <p>
 * InputStream is a pretty basic class that is easily wrapped, because it really only requires
 * a handful of base methods.
 * <p>
 * We cannot make an InputStream into a Binder-passable interface directly, because its definitions
 * includes throwing IOExceptions. It also defines multiple methods with the same name and a
 * different parameter list, which is not supported in aidl.
 * <p>
 * You should never throw an exception in your Binder interface. We catch the exceptions and
 * return -2 instead, because conveniently all the methods we override should return values >= -1.
 * More complex classes would require more complex solutions.
